## Introduction

Restr is a Restaurant Application for the people who lookin for the Restaurant, Foods, Drinks, anything about that.

In this project, is to accomplish Submission Dicoding in Flutter Fundamental Course, and i use Riverpod for it. for details you can see [here](#tech-stack).

The challenge here is that I created a restaurant app with Riverpod Architecture, which is i never implement it before, so it was very challenging for me. To see what features I made, you can see [here](#features).

I, use Rivderpod as my State Management, Dependency Injection, and Service Locator.. To see what Dependencies I created, you can see [here](#dependencies).
